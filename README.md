# Discord.jsActivityCommand
A simple command to have your Discord bot's activity status change every minute. 
Take the ActivityStatusScript.js script and put it inside of your main javascript file.
Once done with that take the Activity.json script which you can now change the "test" portions of the code to be whatever you like, and branch it to fit into your bots file paths. (however you have that setup, you may need to work with the code a bit is what im saying)
After that should be good to go, enjoy!
