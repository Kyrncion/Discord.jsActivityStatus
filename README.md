# Discord.jsActivityCommand
A simple command to have your Discord bot's activity status change every minute. 
Take the main file and put it inside of your main javascript file 
Take the activty status script which you can now alter to be watching (whatever) playing (whatever) and branch it to match to your bots file paths
after that should be good to go, enjoy!
